Directory layout
----------------

artifacts: Will contain artifacts from successful builds.

deb: Contains files necessary to build a .deb-package.

docker-images: Contains build scripts for all docker images used to build packages for different distributions.

rpm: Contains files necessary to build an .rpm-package.

All scripts in this directory except "docker-build.sh" should automatically produce an artifact with little to no input.

Building all artifacts
----------------------
Running build-all.sh currently produces:
* A source package
* An ITG2 arcade compatible machine revision (x86)
* An opensuse rpm package (x86_64)
* Ubuntu compatible debian packages (x86_64)

Instructions:
1. Make sure your OS architecture is x86_64.
2. Install docker.
3. Make sure the latest git tag is the release version.
   Requirements:
   * Must start with a digit
   * Must NOT contain the following characters -
4. Have a private rsa key available for signing the machine revision. The openitg wiki contains intructions on how to make one.
5. As root, run:
    # cd build/
    # ./build-all.sh private.rsa
